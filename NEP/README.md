# MgSbBi-alloy-NEP-potential
Here we provide the Neuroevolution-potential(NEP)[^1], the data sets used to fit can be found in MTP/training.
## MC/MD
The MCMD folder contains input files for using LAMMPS to simulate the solute partitioning behaviour in a Mg<sub>3</sub>(Sb<sub>0.75</sub>Bi<sub>0.25</sub>)<sub>2</sub> structure with a twist grain boundary.
## NEMD
The NEMD folder contains input files for using GPUMD[^1] to simulate the thermal resistance of the twist grain boundary in a Mg<sub>3</sub>(Sb<sub>0.75</sub>Bi<sub>0.25</sub>)<sub>2</sub> structure. 

[^1]: The Neuroevolution-potential generation and NEMD simulation are running with the GPUMD package published in website https://gpumd.org.
