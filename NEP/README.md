# MgSbBi-alloy-NEP-potential
Here we provide the Neuroevolution-potential(NEP)[^1], the data set used for fitting can be found in MTP/training.
## MC/MD
The MCMD branch includes input files for using LAMMPS to simulate the solute partitioning behaviour of Mg<sub>3</sub>(Sb<sub> 0.75</sub>Bi<sub>0.25</sub>)<sub>2</sub> structure with a twist grain boundarie.
## NEMD
The NEMD branch includes input files for using GPUMD[^1] to simulate the thermal resistance of the twist grain boundary in a Mg<sub>3</sub>(Sb<sub> 0.75</sub>Bi</sub>0.25</sub>)<sub>2</sub> structure. 

[^1]: The Neuroevolution-potential generation and NEMD simulation are executed with the GPUMD package. See the website https://gpumd.org/ for details.
