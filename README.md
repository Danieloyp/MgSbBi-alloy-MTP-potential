# MgSbBi-alloy-potential
Datasets for fitting the machine learning interatomic potential of MgSgBi alloy and related examples.
## Moment Tensor Potential(MTP)
This branch contains the MTP models and running examples, which could be used to predict the lattice thermal conductivity of the Mg<sub>3</sub>(Sb<sub>1-x</sub>Bi<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub> thermoelectric material. The related results were published in our article[^1].
## Neuroevolution-potential(NEP)
This branch contains the NEP models for Mg<sub>3</sub>(Sb<sub>1-x</sub>Bi<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub> thermoelectric material. The datasets for fitting the NEP potentials are the same as that for the MTP potentials. We also provide an example of performing nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation.
